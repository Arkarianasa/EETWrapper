# EETWrapper
Czech EET Wrapper in .NET

Completely using WCF features. No HTML replace bullshit. :-)

**UPDATE 2016-10-21**
- Basic code in EETProvider
  - Logging for the moment done with an event, we will see if this is a good approach
- Almost done with the mapping of EETData to EET message objects
- Preparations for multilanguage support with resources
